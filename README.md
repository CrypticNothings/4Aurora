An attempt at a website....for my daughter.
I want to create something for her for when I'm not around to remember all the things growing up we had fun with. We enjoy video games together, watching certain youtube videos and music.
I'm imagining the website pages more as rooms where there's something maybe interactive to spend time on. For example, in the music room I want to simply list some of my own songs but I also want to create an interactive piano and maybe a drum machine to just play with. 
I'm coming up with ideas as I go as this is the biggest project I've taken on.
I finally commited to learning how to code. I've messed around all my life but I've only taken it serious just recently. 
I think this is a great project to test my skills as I continue learning.
