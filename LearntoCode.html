        <h3>Lesson 1: What is Coding?</h3>
        <p>Hey there, curious coder! Have you ever wondered how a computer knows what to do? Let's dive into the magical world of coding to find out!</p>
        <h4>Explanation</h4>
        <p>Imagine you have a computer friend. But guess what? Computers are a bit like magic boxes. They can't do anything on their own, but we can make them do incredible things using special secret codes. That's what coding is all about!</p>
        <h4>Activity: Talking to Robots</h4>
        <p>Imagine you have a robot buddy. Robots are super smart, but they only understand special robot language. That's where coding comes in. We give the robot clear and simple instructions in the language it understands, just like talking to a friend.</p>
        <h4>Example: Making a Sandwich</h4>
        <p>Imagine you're telling a robot how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You have to say each step very clearly, like "Spread peanut butter on one slice of bread" and "Put the jelly on the other slice." The robot follows your steps to make the sandwich just right.</p>
        <h4>Discussion</h4>
        <p>How cool is that? Coding is like being a super bossy friend to robots, telling them exactly what to do to make amazing things happen.</p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>So, remember, coding is like magic words that make computers and robots follow our instructions. We can use coding to create fun games, beautiful websites, and even make robots dance! Let's dive in and have a coding adventure together!</p>

        <h3>Lesson 2: Let's Build with HTML Blocks!</h3>
        <p>Hey there, young coder! You know, web pages are like awesome online houses. And guess what? We're going to learn how to build them using special blocks called HTML tags!</p>
        <h4>Explanation</h4>
        <p>HTML tags are like magic commands that tell computers how to show things on a webpage. Imagine they're like special instructions for your computer friend.</p>
        <h4>Activity: Building a Webpage</h4>
        <p>Imagine we're making a cool webpage about your favorite things. Let's use some HTML tags, which are like special stickers you put on things to make them look a certain way.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Big Title:</strong> Imagine the biggest sticker you've ever seen. That's <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>! It's for the main title of our page.
            Let's write: <code>&lt;h1&gt;My Awesome Webpage!&lt;/h1&gt;</code></li>
            <li><strong>Tell a Story:</strong> Imagine a book page with words. That's <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>! It's for writing stories or explaining things.
            Let's write: <code>&lt;p&gt;I love drawing, playing games, and exploring. This is so much fun!&lt;/p&gt;</code></li>
            <li><strong>Break It Up:</strong> Imagine a line that says "pause." That's <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>! It's for making a new line.
            Let's write: <code>&lt;p&gt;Do you know what's super fun?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring and learning new things!&lt;/p&gt;</code></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Discussion</h4>
        <p>Wow, look what we did! We made a webpage using special HTML blocks! So, HTML tags are like instructions we give to the computer to show things like titles, stories, and even line breaks.</p>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>HTML tags are our magical building blocks for web pages. We tell the computer what to do, and it shows things on the screen! Isn't it amazing? You're now a cool coder who knows how to use HTML blocks to build your very own web pages!</p>
